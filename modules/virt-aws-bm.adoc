= {VirtProductName} on AWS bare metal

You can run {VirtProductName} on an Amazon Web Services (AWS) bare-metal {product-title} cluster. Before you set up your cluster, review the following summary of supported features and limitations:

Installing::
--
* You can install the cluster by using installer-provisioned infrastructure, ensuring that you specify bare-metal node instance types in the `install-config.yaml` file. For example, you can use the `c5n.metal` type value for a machine based on x86_64 architecture.
+
For more information, see the {product-title} documentation about installing on AWS.
--

Accessing virtual machines (VMs)::
--
* There is no change to how you access VMs by using the `virtctl` CLI tool or the {product-title} web console.
* You can expose VMs by using a `NodePort` or `LoadBalancer` service. 
** The load balancer approach is preferable because {product-title} automatically creates the load balancer in AWS and manages its lifecycle. A security group is also created for the load balancer, and you can use annotations to attach existing security groups. When you remove the service, {product-title} removes the load balancer and its associated resources.
--

Networking::
--
* You cannot use Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) or bridge Container Network Interface (CNI) networks, including virtual LAN (VLAN). If your application requires a flat layer 2 network or control over the IP pool, consider using OVN-Kubernetes secondary overlay networks.
--

Storage::
--
* link:https://docs.portworx.com/portworx-enterprise/install-portworx/openshift[Portworx] is supported as a storage provider for {VirtProductName} on AWS bare metal.
** To use Portworx with {VirtProductName}, you must configure the `StorageClass` manifest to support live migration. For example:
+

* Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) and Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) are not supported for use with {VirtProductName} due to performance and functionality limitations.
