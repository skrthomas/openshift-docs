= Infrastructure considerations for MetalLB

MetalLB is primarily useful for on-premise, bare metal installations because these installations do not include a native load-balancer capability.
In addition to bare metal installations, installations of {product-title} on some infrastructures might not include a native load-balancer capability.
For example, the following infrastructures can benefit from adding the MetalLB Operator:

* Bare metal

* VMware vSphere

* {ibmzProductName} and {linuxoneProductName}

* {ibmzProductName} and {linuxoneProductName} for {op-system-base-full} KVM

* {ibmpowerProductName}

MetalLB Operator and MetalLB are supported with the OpenShift SDN and OVN-Kubernetes network providers.

== Additional Network and MetalLB cannot use same network

Using the same VLAN for both MetalLB and an additional network interface set up on a source pod may result in a connection failure. This occurs when both the MetalLB IP and the source pod reside on the same node.

To avoid connection failures, place the MetalLB IP in a different subnet from the one where the source pod resides. This configuration ensures that traffic from the source pod will take the default gateway, which is typically OVN-Kubernetes. Consequently, the traffic can effectively reach its destination by using the OVN overlay network, ensuring that the connection functions as intended.
