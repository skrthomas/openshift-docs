= Limitations for BGP mode

[id="nw-metallb-bgp-limitations-break-connections_{context}"]
== Node failure can break all active connections

MetalLB shares a limitation that is common to BGP-based load balancing.
When a BGP session terminates, such as when a node fails or when a `speaker` pod restarts, the session termination might result in resetting all active connections.
End users can experience a `Connection reset by peer` message.

The consequence of a terminated BGP session is implementation-specific for each router manufacturer.
However, you can anticipate that a change in the number of `speaker` pods affects the number of BGP sessions and that active connections with BGP peers will break.

To avoid or reduce the likelihood of a service interruption, you can specify a node selector when you add a BGP peer.
By limiting the number of nodes that start BGP sessions, a fault on a node that does not have a BGP session has no affect on connections to the service.

[id="additional_network_and_metallb_limitation_{context}"]
== Additional Network and MetalLB cannot use same network

There is a limitation when using the same VLAN for both MetalLB and an additional network interface on a source pod. In such cases, a connection failure occurs, when the MetalLB IP and the source pod share the same node.

You can address this by ensuring the MetalLB IP is in another subnet so the traffic coming from a pod would take the default gateway, which is OVN-K and reach the destination via the OVN overlay. Alternatively use a MACVLAN interface instead of a VLAN interface.

[id="nw-metallb-bgp-limitations-single-asn_{context}"]
== Support for a single ASN and a single router ID only

When you add a BGP peer custom resource, you specify the `spec.myASN` field to identify the Autonomous System Number (ASN) that MetalLB belongs to.
{product-title} uses an implementation of BGP with MetalLB that requires MetalLB to belong to a single ASN.
If you attempt to add a BGP peer and specify a different value for `spec.myASN` than an existing BGP peer custom resource, you receive an error.

Similarly, when you add a BGP peer custom resource, the `spec.routerID` field is optional.
If you specify a value for this field, you must specify the same value for all other BGP peer custom resources that you add.

The limitation to support a single ASN and single router ID is a difference with the community-supported implementation of MetalLB.
